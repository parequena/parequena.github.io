This repository has not been created with any purpouse, and I'm just a developer trying to learn, something new.

## Todo

 - Create project to compile C++ code into WASM to create tiny code examples.
	 - This project should have:
		 - Nice structure.
		 - Easy to use and understand
		 - CMake automation
		 - Follow C++/CMake [CPP's best practices](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cppbestpractices)

## File structure

## Technologies
( or desired ones )

- C++17/20
- CMake
- WASM
- Any package manager C++/WASM compatible (Conan, VCPKG, etc)
- Any lib compatible with C++/WASM
- Something to do any page pretty (i'm not a web developer)
